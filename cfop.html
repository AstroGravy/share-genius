    <h1>The CFOP speedsolving method</h1>
    <p>CFOP is an acronym for Cross, F2L, OLL, and PLL</p>
    <p>It splits the solve into those 4 steps.</p>
    <p>It is a speedsolving method used by the world record holders. However, they have even more advanced methods that sort of combine these steps.</p>
    <p>It is a layer-by layer method of solving, where you solve the bottom layer, then middle, then top layer. Fun fact: the beginner's method is a more simple type of layer-by layer solving.</p>
    <p>Vocab note: when solving cubers get 15 seconds of "inspection" where they can look at the cube and plan some moves. Generally, speedcubers at least plan the cross and maybe some of F2L, but no more than that. I usually only can plan part of the cross and definitely not any F2L pairs.</p>
    <h2>Cross</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>In this step 4 edge pieces of the same color are solved, creating a cross shape.</li>
        <li>It doesn't really have any algorithms, just finding the most efficient way to solve it during <span class="vocab">inspection</span>.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>F2L</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Stands for First 2 Layers</li>
        <li>In this step the first two layers of the cube are solved, solving 8 pieces in total (4 corner and 4 edge).</li>
        <li>This step takes the longest out of them all.</li>
        <li>This step has intuitiveness like the cross, but there are some algorithms needed for advanced F2L.</li>
        <li>I use beginner's F2L when I solve the cube and have started a few of the advanced strategies, but not the algoriths.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>OLL</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Stands for Orientation of the Last Layer</li>
        <li>In this step the top layer (or last unsolved layer) is oriented (the pieces are rotated/turned) such that the top layer has the same color across it (so if you had a white cross, the whole yellow side would show yellow).</li>
        <li>There are 57 algorithms for OLL, with many of them not being very intuitive like the cross or F2L.</li>
        <li>I use 2-look OLL and a beginner's method strategy to solve it. This means that I take at most 2 steps to solve it instead of 1, but I only had to memorize a few algorithms that were fairly easy.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>PLL</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Stands for Permutation of the Last Layer</li>
        <li>In this step the top layer (or last unsolved layer) is permutated (the pieces are shifted around with each other) such that the top layer - and the whole cube - has each piece in the correct position regardless of orientation (but the orientation would already be solved in OLL).</li>
        <li>There are 21 algorithms for PLL, with many of them not being very intuitive like the cross or F2L. Some of them follow a pattern which makes them more similar to each other than OLL algs are.</li>
        <li>I use a sort of 2-look PLL strategy to solve it, which means that I didn't learn it with the intent of knowing the specific 2-look algorithms, I just memorized a few that were necessary and looked the easiest. I know about 8 of the algorithms.</li>
    </ul>
