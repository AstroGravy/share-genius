    <h2>Subject: Speedcubing</h2>
    <p>I know how to solve a Rubik's cube and occaisonally like to see how fast I can solve a 3x3.</p>
    <p>I also know how to solve a 4x4 and 2x2, but I haven't attempted any larger cube.</p>
    <p>This is known as Speedcubing, where people try to solve puzzles like Rubik's cubes as fast as they can.</p>

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>When I was in 5th or 6th grade, I found a Rubik's cube in my house and wanted to learn how to solve it.</p>
    <p>So, I looked up a tutorial online and found one on YouTube.</p>
    <p>I found <a href="https://youtu.be/7Ron6MN45LY">this tutorial</a> (which is a very good tutorial btw I highly recommend it) and was able to solve it and them memorize how to solve it in about 3 hours.</p>
    <p>Then, I wanted to learn how to solve it faster, so I bought an expensive cube (it was $80 ðŸ’€) and watched more tutorials. The cube is a Gan M 11 Pro.<img src="images/gan m 11 pro image.jpg" style="width: 200px; float: right; margin-top: -100px;"> I still use that cube today.</p>
    <p>I was able to average a solve of under 1 minute and my best time was 26 seconds (got lucky). To this day I haven't beaten that but I have gotten a 27 second solve recently and am getting faster. My current average is about 45 seconds.</p>

    <h2>How I solve the cube</h2>
    <p>I solve a 3x3 Rubik's cube by using beginner's CFOP (different from beginner's method).</p>
    <p>Find more on the CFOP solving method in <a href="cfop.html">this page</a>.</p>
